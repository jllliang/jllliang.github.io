I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology of China (https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), focusing on knowledge enhancement for large language models. I am enthusiastic about contributing to the rapidly evolving field of AI and its potential to transform numerous aspects of technology and society. I welcome opportunities for collaboration and intellectual exchange with fellow researchers and industry professionals who share an interest in this exciting area of study.
